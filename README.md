# login_registration-form-java
This repo contains code to create a login and registration form in java, then connect it to a database (Using JDBC).

Includes:
 * A dashboard containing the current user's name, and an option to add a new account.
 * Code to check whether the required database and table exist
 
If the database already has records, running the program directs the user to the login page. However if no records exist, it opens in the registration page.
